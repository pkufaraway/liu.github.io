## The main purpose of this series
As my internship is nearly finished, I decide to write a tech-review for all the amazing features that I have learnt during this summer.

Today I gonna talk about some useful tools/features that can be applied to your terminal, make it happier.

**Notice that this is for Mac OS users only.**

### Try iTerm2
You can try iTerm2 [here](https://www.iterm2.com/).
You can checkout their impressive features [here](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html).

### ZSH
Zsh is one of the shell that you can use, the reason why I love it is its wonderful theme plugins and best auto-completion that I've met. Using oh my zsh with zsh can give me a totally different shell compared to the Mac OS X's own shell.

### oh-my-zsh
oh my zsh is a cute name, isn't it?
